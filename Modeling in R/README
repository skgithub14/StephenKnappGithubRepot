This folder contains my example code in R of creating and analyzing mathematical models in R.

The following types of models and supporting techniques can be found here:
- Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA)
- Quadratic Discriminate Analysis (QDA)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
- Cluster Analysis
- Neural Networks (simple)
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Tree based models (mostly Random Forests)
