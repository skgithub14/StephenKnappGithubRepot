This folder contains examples of my machine learning code in Python using TensorFlow, Keras and PyTorch for a variety of applications
to include regression, classification, computer vision, NLP and time series.

The deep learning network types of neural networks applied in this code include: 
- Long-short Term Memory (LSTM)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) 
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- Auto-encoders (AE) including denoising AEs
